# Garden-Monitoring-and-Automatic-Watering-System-Based-on-Internet-of-Things-Using-Blynk-ESP8266
The hardware design features an Arduino Nano and Wemos D1 Mini, utilizing DHT22 and Soil Moisture sensors for environmental monitoring. The system automatically waters plants when soil moisture falls below 30%, using the Blynk app for real-time data visualization and remote management. Sensor accuracy is high with only a 1.5% temperature discrepancy. This setup enhances efficiency in irrigation by saving time, water, and resources, promising advancements in IoT and automation for agriculture. Future developments include integrating renewable energy and enhancing remote control capabilities.
